Hotdish
=======

An exploration social tab and general browser experience sharing.

We want to see how we can share our browser activity, and as we continue development we'll be using that shared space as a launching point for other collaborative interactions.

If you use Hotdish, please [tell us what you think](hotdish@mozilla.com).

This is developed as a Firefox addon.  We make no claims about future development, we're just trying things out.


Install/Usage
-------------

1. Click https://people.mozilla.com/~glind/hotdish.xpi
2. In Firefox, go to `View > Sidebar > Share with hotdishgroup`
3. Close the Sidebar to stop collaborating.
4. Be aware everyone in the group sees everything you open *in that window*.

Everything you do in the window with that sidebar opened will be shared with everyone else in the hotdishgroup group.

If you want to change your group, open the Addon preferences for the addon, change the group name, and restart your browser.

Developing
----------

This is developed as a Firefox addon, requiring Firefox 26 or later, and uses the [Addon-SDK](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/).
